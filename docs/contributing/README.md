## 2. Commit Standards

We follow the **_Conventional Commit_** standards to ensure clear and meaningful commit messages. Use the format:

```azure
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

### 2.1. Commit Types

- `breaking`: Introduce a breaking change that may require users to modify their code or dependencies.
- `feat`: Add a new feature that enhances the functionality of the project.
- `fix`: Apply a bug fix that resolves an issue without affecting functionality.
- `task`: Add or modify internal functionality that supports the codebase but doesn't introduce a new feature or fix a bug (e.g., utility methods, service logic, or internal improvements).
- `chore`: Miscellaneous or updates that aren't features or fixes (e.g., updating build tools, dependencies, or configuration files).
- `docs`: Modify documentation, such as fixing typos or adding new content.
- `style`: Apply code style or formatting changes that do not affect behavior.
- `refactor`: Restructure existing code without changing its external behavior.
- `test`: Add or modify tests without affecting functionality.

## 3. Development Environment Setup

If you are working on the frontend, make sure you have the correct version of Node.js.

### 3.1. Node.js Version

This project uses **Vite**, which requires **Node.js v18 or later**.

#### Check your Node version:

```bash
node -v
```

If it is below `v18`, follow the steps below to upgrade using `nvm`.

### 3.2 Installing `nvm` (Node Version Manager)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Then restart your terminal or run the following command:

```
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc, depending on your shell
```

### 3.3. Install & Use the Correct Node Version

```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

You should now be on a compatible version:

```bash
node -v  # should show v20.x.x
```

Then run the project as usual:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3.4. Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
|`npm run dev`| Starts the dev server |
|`npm run build`| Builds the app for production |
|`npm run preview`| Previews the production build |
|`npm run lint`| Lints the codebase |
|`npm run test`| Runs unit tests (if configured) |
|`npm run lint:fix`| Automatically fixes linting issues using ESLint |
|`npm run format`| Formats all your JavaScript, JSX, CSS, and Markdown files in `src/` using Prettier|
